                            It is as though the concepts of minimalism and clutter are inevitably fusing into a singularity: when disposability or recyclability is built into the act of acquisition, the very idea of accumulation falls to the wayside.

                            I was struck by something that homeware designer Olympia Irving said when I interviewed her for my upcoming book New English Interiors: ‘as soon as you start placing things with intention, it stops being clutter.’ It’s very true: so long as you put a bit of thought into the placement of objects – even if they appear incidentally placed to the outside eye – it’s highly unlikely that they will look chaotic. 
                            <!-- Benedict suggests the spacing between things is crucial: ‘without this, everything becomes a jumble – imagine a book without spacing between words or punctuation, the meaning is easily lost,’ he says. ‘At our cottage, I’ve just squeezed a lot of words into a small format book,’ he adds with a laugh. -->

                    Text extends explanation beyond what is immediately visible, preferring over-clarification to misreading.

                                It is as though the concepts of minimalism and clutter are inevitably fusing into a singularity: when disposability or recyclability is built into the act of acquisition, the very idea of accumulation falls to the wayside. And this process is only accelerating as more and more of our lives – especially our shopping – takes place in virtual online spaces. Acquisition itself also changes meaning, as things we purchase come in the form of data rather than goods: today, we often ‘borrow’ and ‘share’ rather than physically own.

                                I was struck by something that homeware designer Olympia Irving said when I interviewed her for my upcoming book New English Interiors: ‘as soon as you start placing things with intention, it stops being clutter.’ It’s very true: so long as you put a bit of thought into the placement of objects – even if they appear incidentally placed to the outside eye – it’s highly unlikely that they will look chaotic. Benedict suggests the spacing between things is crucial: ‘without this, everything becomes a jumble – imagine a book without spacing between words or punctuation, the meaning is easily lost,’ he says. ‘At our cottage, I’ve just squeezed a lot of words into a small format book,’ he adds with a laugh.
